This collection of scripts are designed to log the cursor position and create a
heatmap image of the data.

= Instructions for use =

Generate the log file by recording the cursor location using,

	./run_collection.sh

You may want to edit this script to set the poll time for samples, and also
choose how you want the data seperated. You can put it all in one file, or one
file per day, per hour, per minute... Currently you get one logfile per hour.

When you have some logfiles, generate the heatmap image using,

	./makeheatmap.sh logs/file.log

This will make 2 images one with all the data samples, the other with
consecutive data samples that are the same are removed (u, short for uniq,
appended to filename) (this roughly means dots are not drawn on the heat map
when the mouse is still).

You may also need to tweek the alpha values in makeheatmap.sh.
